## Local weather App

### User Stories

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.


### Note 

Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather.
